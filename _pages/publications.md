## Sample essay
### System Dynamics and Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis
[This](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/SD/Minsky.pdf) is a concise literature review on the topic of financial instability hypothesis from a system dynamics perspective.

### Solving the Traveling Salesman with Profit (TSPP) problem using Any Colony System (ACS)
This [project](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/Project.pdf) was part of a graduate level course on [Heuristic Optimization](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/IE_517_syllabus.PDF). The aim was to solve implement an algorithm to solve multiple instances of TSPP problem.
