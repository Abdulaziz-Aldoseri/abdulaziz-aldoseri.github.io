## M.S. Thesis (Work in Progress)
This thesis aims to solve the problem of natural gas storage valuation. [Here](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/MS_thesis/Proposal.pdf) you can find the thesis proposal.

I will share the source code for the thesis very soon.

## Sample essay
### The Minsky Moment from a System Dynamics Perspective
[This](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/SD/Minsky.pdf) is a concise literature review of Minsky's financial instability hypothesis from a system dynamics perspective.


## Sample of previous projects
**Disclaimer**: _All code is provided as is. There is no warranty that it runs on your platform, or that it will be appropriate to solve your problem. Unfortunately, I will not be able to reply to questions on how to run the code on a particular platform. I would be happy to receive reports on ways to improve the code and potential mistakes. If you end up using the code, please send me an email to let me know what the particular problem you worked on was._

### Solving the Traveling Salesman with Profit (TSPP) problem using Any Colony System (ACS)
This [project](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/Project.pdf) was part of a graduate-level course on [Heuristic Optimization](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/IE_517_syllabus.PDF). The aim was to implement an algorithm to solve multiple instances of the TSPP problem.

Click [here](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/TSPP.rar) to download the code (C++), TSPP instances and a short report.

### Ecological Simulation and Analysis Using System Dynamics
This project was part of a graduate-level course on [System Dynamics](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/SD/IE_550_syllabus.PDF). The aim was to simulate and analyze the dynamics of an endangered fish species given different government protective policies.

### Evolution of Trust Using Agent-Based Modeling
This project was part of a graduate-level course on [Agent-Based Modeling](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/ABM/Syllabus.pdf). The aim was to simulate and analyze the evolution of trust in an agent-based model given different behavioral. game-theoritic, settings.
