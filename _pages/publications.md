### Solving the Traveling Salesman with Profit (TSPP) Problem using Any Colony System (ACS)
This [project](https://github.com/Abdulaziz-Aldoseri/abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/blob/master/_misc/Project.pdf) was part of a graduate level course on [Heuristic Optimization](https://github.com/Abdulaziz-Aldoseri/abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/blob/master/_misc/IE_517_syllabus.PDF). The aim was to solve implement an algorithm to solve multiple instances of TSPP problem.
