## Sample essay
### System Dynamics and Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis
[This](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/SD/Minsky.pdf) is a concise literature review on the topic of financial instability hypothesis from a system dynamics perspective.


## Sample of previous projects

Unfortunately, I will not be able to reply to questions on how to run the code on a particular platform. I would be happy to receive reports on ways to improve the code and potential mistakes. If you end up using the code, please send me an email to let me know what the particular problem you worked on was._

### Solving the Traveling Salesman with Profit (TSPP) problem using Any Colony System (ACS)
This [project](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/Project.pdf) was part of a graduate level course on [Heuristic Optimization](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/IE_517_syllabus.PDF). The aim was to solve implement an algorithm to solve multiple instances of TSPP problem.

Click [here](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/TSPP.rar) to download the c++ code, TSPP instances and a short report.

### Ecological simulation and analysis using System Dynamics
This project was part of a graduate level course on [System Dynamics](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/SD/IE_550_syllabus.PDF). The aim was to simualte and analyze the dynamics of an endangered fish species given different government protective policies.
