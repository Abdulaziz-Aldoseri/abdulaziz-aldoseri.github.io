## M.S. Thesis - Natural Gas Storage Valuation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
This thesis aims to solve the problem of natural gas storage valuation. Click [here](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/MS_thesis/Abdulaziz_Aldoseri_Thesis.pdf) to download it.

Main highlights of the thesis:
* Demonstrated the viability of Deep Reinforcement Learning for valuing natural gas storage assets, providing energy merchant companies with an innovative tool for investment decision-making and acquisition strategies.
* Developed a DRL model using the SAC algorithm for natural gas storage valuation, leveraging ANNs for high-dimensional decision-making and real price data for accurate trading.
* Validated the modelâ€™s performance through formal benchmarking against PPO and TD3, with enhanced reproducibility and decision accuracy.

## Sample Essay

## Sample of Previous Projects

### Traveling Salesman Problem with Profits (TSPP) using Ant Colony System (ACS)
This [project](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/Project.pdf) was part of a graduate-level course on [Heuristic Optimization](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/IE_517_syllabus.PDF). The aim was to implement an algorithm to solve multiple instances of the TSPP problem.

Click [here](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/TSPP_ACS/TSPP.rar) to download the code (C++), TSPP instances, and a short report.

### Ecological Simulation and Analysis Using System Dynamics
This project was part of a graduate-level course on [System Dynamics](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/SD/IE_550_syllabus.PDF). The aim was to simulate and analyze the dynamics of an endangered fish species given different government protective policies.

Click [here](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/SD/Project.rar) to download the simulation code (VENSIM) and report.

### Evolution of Trust Using Agent-Based Modeling
This project was part of a graduate-level course on [Agent-Based Modeling](https:///abdulaziz-aldoseri.github.io/files/ABM/Syllabus.pdf). The aim was to simulate and analyze the evolution of trust in an agent-based model given different behavioral, game-theoretic settings.
