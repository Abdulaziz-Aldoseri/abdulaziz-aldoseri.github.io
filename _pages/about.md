I am an Industrial Engineering master's student at [Bogazici University](https://ie.boun.edu.tr/), Istanbul. I am also a Research Associate (on study leave) at [DERASAT](https://www.derasat.org.bh/research-analysis/experts/abdulaziz-aldosseri/), Bahrain. I have worked at DERASAT since 2014, conducting policy research in energy economics. I have an M.A. in [Economics](https://www.binghamton.edu/economics/index.html) from SUNY at Binghamton ([Fulbright Scholarship](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/)) and a B.Sc. in [Information Systems](https://cit.uob.edu.bh/our-departments/information-systems/) from The University of Bahrain.

Research
------
My main research interests are in the areas of:

**Stochastic Optimization**

I am mainly interested in problems in which sequential decision-making is done in a stochastic environment. In my M.S. thesis, I attempted to solve the problem of natural gas storage valuation using Deep RL.

**Energy Value-Chain Optimization**

On the application side, I am interested in applying OR methods to energy value-chain optimization problems. This includes the whole value chain, with a particular emphasis on mid and down streams.
